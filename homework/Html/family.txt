Our Family



We are Stacy and John and we live in a camper
down by the river.

We have a dog, Barkley.
Barkley is a good dog.

She sleeps a lot and digs up the grass.
We feed her twice a day.



We have two kids, Jordan and Caiden.
They're girls. 
They like to eat, cry, and play.
We like them a lot.
